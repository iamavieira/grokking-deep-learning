Machine Learning from scratch! This repo keeps track of my progress in the book Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew Trask,

Each chapter is enumerated by folder and contains one or more notebooks with the theory and the code that I developed along the way.

There are also challenges, which per Trask's request, I did from memory, but you'll have to trust me on this one, or test me, who knows.
